In Ling Ma’s novel _Severance_, the fictional Shen Fever creates in its
victims a compulsion for mindless repetition. They lose themselves in
the return to old routines.

But for me in recent years, return and repetition have come to feel
generative. To return to something familiar and see it in a new way
feels like a gift. It’s a way of catching a glimpse of your changing
self reflected back to you.

This last week’s trip from Wassaic through Massachusetts to
Montpelier, Vermont was such a return.

I’m not sure when I first visited Vermont--I must have been there as a
child (I grew up not so far away), but if so I have no memory of
it. Then I spent many years living in the south and midwest.

But in 2018--not long after I returned to the northeast--I [took my
first bike trip through the state](//vermont), from St. Albans down to Stratton
Mountain and back up to Randolph. It was the week in October when it
turned cold and I was unprepared; I lost my wallet in the snow and,
for a bit, the feeling in my toes. But I fell in love with the state
and I keep going back.

Stealth-camping along the Roundabout Brattleboro route with Chris in
2021 convinced me to switch from a tent to a hammock (trees being
notably easier to find than flat ground in the Green Mountain State).

A [southbound VTXL ride with Alex E in 2022](//vtxl) (with near-perfect weather)
opened my eyes to just how thickly connected the dirt roads are there;
we barely saw pavement for 300 miles, from Canada to Massachusetts.

In 2023 a bunch of [ADV](https://www.nycadv.com/) friends did a
Lake-Champlain-adjacent loop over the Memorial Day weekend, and later
that year I’d pass through the state again on my Eastern Divide ride.

In April of this year I did a three-day loop for the solar eclipse
with my friend Josh: from Burlington to South Hero Island in Lake
Champlain, across to New York and then back to Vermont.

And last week five of us (Alex S, Brad, Jason, Robby, and me) spent
five days riding many of these familiar roads. The route came together
at the last minute–originally, we’d planned to end in Glens Falls, New
York, where Josh (who’d planned to join) had a wedding to attend. But
three weeks ago he was hit by a car, breaking six ribs and puncturing
his lung. He will make a full recovery–but he’s off the bike for a
while. So the rest of us decided to change up the route a bit; from
the end of the Metro North’s Harlem line at Wassaic, we’d head north
into Massachusetts and then pick up the VTXL route northbound at the
Vermont border; we’d do about 2/3 of the VTXL before diverting west to
Montpelier (chosen for two reasons: its Amtrak service, and the Three
Penny Taproom’s excellent selection of delicious Vermont beer).

Our friend Brad put together the final route. Brad was an ADV regular
for years before moving to Mexico City in 2021, and he flew back with
his bike for this trip. While living in Mexico he’s been doing a ton
of riding in the mountains and participated in a few competitive
endurance gravel events--all of which is to say that he’s very strong
and very fast these days.

This was a hard ride. The weather (in the 90s almost every day) was
some of the hottest I’ve toured in--hotter than Cuba in 2020. The heat
and humidity brought out the bugs–plenty of mosquitos, and the
deerflies were swarming in Vermont (somehow by dumb luck I’d managed
to avoid them in my previous trips up north).

And the route was plenty climby. The second day had us riding up
Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. The road to the
summit gains 2,700 feet in nine miles–lunacy, really, with a loaded
bike. But I’d been thinking for years that I should someday try to
climb Greylock on a bike, and it was very satisfying finally to do it.

This was another return for me: I first visited Greylock when I was
something like 12 or 13, to spend a week doing trail work on the
Appalachian Trail. How this came about I’m not sure. Mine was mostly a
sedentary, indoor childhood, centering books and computers. Spending a
week in the woods was very out-of-character for me back then. I am
pretty sure this was the only backpacking trip I ever took as a
kid--it would be over 20 years before I went backpacking again. But
the memory of Greylock stuck with me: the steep and winding road to
the top crisscrossed by hiking trails, the War Memorial and the
CCC-built Bascom Lodge at the summit (during that childhood stint of
trail work we stayed at the lodge for a night before and after). When
I moved back east I made a point of visiting Greylock again (by car)
in 2018.

On this trip Bascom Lodge was closed. But otherwise everything was as
I remembered it. At the summit our phones erupted with emergency
alerts informing us of a statewide 911 outage, so we were
extra-cautious on the descent into Williamstown.

There we met a college friend of Jason’s. Their friendship had its
origins in their shared interest in the economic ideas of Henry
George, which interest on Jason’s part was news to me. The friend
pointed us to an in-town swimming hole in the Green River where we
spent an hour or so cooling off before (somewhat reluctantly) getting
back on our bikes for the final climb across the Vermont border to
camp.

In Vermont we picked up the VTXL route, which meant more climbing and
less pavement than the New York and Masschusetts sections. These were
roads I knew and had ridden, and they felt like old friends. The [old
International Paper road](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gmfl/recarea/?recid=64999) over Stratton Mountain stood out: it’s rutted
and rocky but heavily overgrown, making it hard to pick a line, and
more than one of us fell on the descent. But any momentary pause meant
a dozen or so deerflies appeared instantly on your hand and arms, so
we picked ourselves up quickly and kept going.

Return and repetition, again: Stratton has figured in four of my
Vermont trips. On my first, in 2018, I climbed it on the paved road to
the ski resort in an attempt to reach the campsites at Grout Pond, not
realizing that my intended route took a snowmobile trail to the IP
road; I was on essentially a road bike with 28mm tires, expecting a
road tour, it was raining, and when I arrived at the snowmobile trail
(after dark) it was under several inches of water. I bailed to a ski
lodge partway down the mountain and spent the night indoors. (I still
have never made it to Grout Pond.)

In 2021, on the same unsuitable bike (now with slightly bigger
tires--32mm I think) but with more of an appetite for dirt I rode the
IP road northbound following the [Roundabout Brattleboro route](https://bikepacking.com/routes/roundabout-brattleboro/). This
time I made it through, but broke a spoke in the process. (I feel deep
gratitude to the kind bike mechanic at Equipe Sport in Rawsonville who
was able to get my wheel true enough for me to complete the ride, and
who wouldn’t take any money.)

In 2022 I rode the IP road southbound for the first time. A
revelation! I’d been dreading it the whole trip--Stratton is the
biggest single climb on the VTXL and I knew how rugged the road
was. But going south, you climb on the rough IP road and then have a
smooth, scenic descent down Kelley Stand Road along Lyman Brook into
East Arlington and its excellent store. I think climbing the IP road
may actually be easier than descending it; the grade is not bad and
the rocks don’t kick you around as much at 4mph.

This time were going northbound. I was prepared for the grueling
descent but my friends were not; on an elevation profile, it looks
like you can just coast down the north side of the mountain, but it’s
so rough that you can’t go much more than 10mph, and it’s hard on the
body. A real mountain bike would be more suitable here.

At the bottom of the descent Brad and I stopped at the Stratton
snowmaking pond, which is only a stone’s-throw off-route, but which
I’d never noticed on my previous traverses. This deep, clear pond is
open for swimming in the summer and on this sweltering day it was full
of local families. We soaked our tired bodies for a bit, waiting for
the others.

In Rawsonville we were sad to learn that the excellent burger spot
(Honeypie) is a weekend-only situation, so we settled for the only
other restaurant in town, a combination pizza/pasta/Chinese
place. Then we kept going--Winhall Brook just a few miles out of town
would have been the logical place to camp, but it’s closed due to
damage from last year’s floods, so we kept going to a beautiful (if
buggy) secret stealth spot.

The next day we went off-route at Cavendish (turn left at the gruesome
monument to Phineas Gage, who survived a railroad accident that sent
an iron rod through his skull) to [Singleton’s General Store](https://singletonsvt.com/) in
Proctorsville. As in 2022, I got the brisket-and-horseradish sandwich,
which is not really the thing you want on a hot day of hilly
bikepacking, but which is too good to skip. And as in 2022, the mile
or so of Main Street between Cavendish and Proctorsville seems to run
downhill both ways--a gift from the cycle-touring gods upon which
perhaps it is better not to look too closely.

Later in the day in Woodstock we had our first maple creemees of the
trip (four days in! I don’t know what we were thinking) and took a dip
in the Ottauqueechee River under the Elm Street bridge, where there
are nice little stone steps down to the water and where it is deep
enough to swim and clear enough to count your toes. In New York they’d
put up razor wire around something like this. In Vermont there never
seems to be any question that water is public space (even in
Woodstock! a playground for Rockefellers, and by far the bougiest
place I have been in the state, or maybe anywhere).

It rained a bit and we waited it out over dinner; then another climb
up to the Amity Pond Natural Area, our destination for the night. I
had not been here on previous trips and I don’t recommend it. The pond
in question is green with algae; the lean-to we’d hoped to camp at is
in a low spot next to a stagnant black pool of water a couple dozen
feet across and maybe a foot deep; no good for swimming or drinking
but very congenial to breeding mosquitos in vast swarms. We camped a
little ways away on higher ground where the mosquito pressure was
merely annoying. The most interesting thing about Amity Pond is the
deed restriction forbidding the use of radios–a rule that is hard to
honor in 2024 when every gadget carries several.

In the morning we descended to Sharon (I got lost and ended up
following a network of woods roads down through an extensive
maple-sugaring operation), where a Maplefields (chain gas station) has
taken over an old general store, like The Thing infecting a human
host. In 2022 Alex E and I holed up here after a cold and rainy
descent; this time, on the last day of our ride, we had breakfast and
met [a local](https://fatbikeamerica.com/) who rode a fat bike around the country last year and
claimed to have averaged 18mph.

From Sharon it was (of course) uphill. More beautiful gravel roads
brought us through Chelsea (a charming town where I had my second
creemee of the trip) and past Washington, after which we left the VTXL
route to head toward Montpelier.

I passed through Montpelier twice last year. The first time was in
August, on my Eastern Divide ride, shortly after the [flood in July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2023_Northeastern_United_States_floods). At
that time almost nothing was open downtown; I stayed in an AirBNB
above a bar but the bar was closed while the first floor of the
building was being gutted and rebuilt, like every other storefront
nearby. The second time was at Thanksgiving, by car, after camping two
nights in the snow; that time I was able to visit the reopened Three
Penny Taproom. And that’s where we ended this trip: Brad made it in
first, then the rest of us trickled in over the next half hour, eating
prodigiously and enjoying the novelty of drinking beer mid-day without
having to ride another 10 or 20 or 30 miles after.

I stayed in the same AirBNB as last August; this time the bar was
alive and a band was playing when I went back after dinner. I thought
about stopping in to listen but I was too tired; I worried the music
would keep me up but I was asleep within moments.

Cycling for me is about exploration, and I use [Wandrer.earth](https://wandrer.earth/) to track
how many new miles I cover and how much I’ve seen of each state and
county. After this ride I’ve cycled 4.99% of the bikable roads in
Vermont. Let’s call it five percent--a bit over a thousand miles. I
hope I get to keep going back, that I get to see another thousand
miles of new roads but also that I keep getting to see these old
favorite roads again and again, and that they continue to feel new
each time.
