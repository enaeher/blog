Yesterday I took advantage of the unseasonably mild weather to ride
from Harvard--the northernmost stop on the Metra UP-NW line--to
Kenosha--the northernmost stop on the UP-N line. It's a ride I've
wanted to do for a while, but I've always had difficulty settling on a
route.

In the event I followed [this
route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Harvard+Metra+Station,+North+Eastman+Street,+Harvard,+Illinois/Metra,+13th+Avenue,+Kenosha,+WI/@42.5225942,-88.2095083,11.11z/data=!4m24!4m23!1m15!1m1!1s0x880f5a8c78252a37:0x7eadf4f16bc48c9!2m2!1d-88.6174634!2d42.4198351!3m4!1m2!1d-88.336491!2d42.6547894!3s0x88058f781489d795:0x4af67854dfe189f7!3m4!1m2!1d-88.2237123!2d42.6553313!3s0x8805837510e9fbfb:0xfd963a2d7ce85f6c!1m5!1m1!1s0x88055e432c10488b:0x9625726ed860902e!2m2!1d-87.8257854!2d42.5859823!3e1),
more or less--Harvard to Lake Geneva to Burlington to Kenosha. I went
a bit out of the way to get up to Burlington so I could follow
Wisconsin Highway 142 almost all the way east to Kenosha, because the
[Wisconsin bicycle
map](http://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/travel/bike/bike-maps/county/racine.pdf)
claims that it possesses "best conditions for bicycling" east to
Highway 75 and then "moderate conditions for bicycling" east to
I-94. This assessment is a bit off the mark. While the route does pass
through the quite-scenic wildflower prairies of [Bong State Recreation
Area](http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/richardbong/), it is a fairly
high-volume, very high-speed (55 mph speed limit) road pretty much
straight out of Burlington, with center-line rumble strips that
discourage drivers from giving much room as they pass. The next time I
do this ride I'll skip Burlington and head due east from Lake Geneva
instead.

To its credit, this route did take me through Lyon, where I had for
lunch a delicious chocolate-zucchini-bread muffin made with zucchini
from the proprietor's garden.

As has become my (bad) habit I took too few pictures, and none of the
best parts of the ride, the rollers along Reese and Hebron Roads and
then Hillside Road into Wisconsin. (The descents were especially
exhilirating on a fixed gear.[^1])

With the help of a stiff tailwind I made it to Kenosha with plenty of
time before the next (and only) train of the afternoon. A very
nice session IPA at [Public Craft
Brewing](http://www.publiccraftbrewing.com/) helped the time pass
quickly, and soon enough I was loading my bike onto the train
alongside a glorious Raleigh Tourist, resplendent in its outfit of rod brakes and
whitewall tires--next to which my scratched-up and paint-chipped plain
black bike looked workaday indeed.

[^1]: No, the fixed-gear was not the obvious choice for this ride, but I found myself reaching for it even though the rando bike is back from the shop and right as rain. I can't really explain it. It's growing on me.
