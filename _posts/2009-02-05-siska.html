Tracy Siska at the Chicago Justice Project has <a href="http://www.chicagojustice.org/blog/?p=90">another excellent blog post</a> on the need for and lack of transparency in the police and in the courts in Chicago and Cook County. Tony Peraica wants the <a href="http://www.reformcookcounty.com/budget/peraica-introduces-resolution-to-put-county-check-register-online/">Cook County check register put online</a>. Milan Andric and Brad Flora of the <a href="http://www.windycitizen.com">Windy Citizen</a> have put up <a href="http://repsheet.com">RepSheet</a>, where you can look up your alderman, state representative and senator, and US congressperson in one place, along with the boundaries of their respective wards and districts and relevant press, which they <a href="http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/Content.aspx?audioID=31875">discuss on Eight Forty-Eight here</a>. It's as though I've woken up in an alternate Dick Simpson Chicago. Even the CTA, it is alleged, is just fine with people <a href="http://ctabusapi.jottit.com/">documenting and building a caching proxy around its Bus Tracker API</a>.
