For the first time this year the Forest Preserve District of Cook
County is allowing [camping in the Shabbona Woods forest
preseve](http://fpdcc.com/camping/camp-shabbona-woods/)--and,
eventually, four other locations within the forest preserve
system. I've been anticipating this for a while, so M-- and I decided
to make this our destination for our (belated) first bike-camping trip
of this season--I on my new-to-me Velo Orange Randonneur and she on
her new-to-her Trek 400, freshly be-fendered and equipped with
short-reach brake levers courtesy of [Uptown
Bikes](http://www.uptownbikes.com/).

It's a straight enough shot down the Lakefront Path to the Burnham
Greenway, with the requisite stop at Calumet Fisheries (where we saw
probably a dozen other cyclists pass through while we ate our
food):

At Calumet Park we saw the only Electoral-College-themed graffiti I've
ever seen:

Things got a little messy at the gap in the Burnham Greenway and we
ended up on high-speed, no-shoulder, heavily-trafficked Avenue
O/Burnham Boulevard for longer than I'd have liked. There was one
lonely "To Burnham Greenway" sign coming out of Wolf Lake, but we
never saw another; I'm not sure if we missed a pleasanter route or if
this is the best there is. At any rate, I'm glad I signed the Active
Trans petition to [close this
gap](http://activetrans.org/blog/support-closing-gap-burnham-greenway)
last week.

The campground, in the end, was a disappointment. The FPDCC
campgrounds are apparently being managed by a [golf-course-management
agency](http://www.billycaspergolf.com/), and it shows. While the
forest preserve itself was heavily wooded and very attractive, the
campground area had been completely denuded of any trees and had all
the charm (and privacy) of a parking lot.

Moreover, we couldn't even escape the desolation on one of the several
hiking trails into the woods because--I swear this is true--at
5:00pm, more than three hours before sunset and only minutes after our
arrival, the _barbed-wire-topped gate_ into these trails was closed
and locked.

We ran into one other group of cyclists (from Logan Square) who,
sharing our opinion of the campground, were cutting short their
planned two-night stay. It's a shame that this campground was so
poorly thought out; there is real potential here and it would be
lovely to have more camping options closer to the city. Other county
forest preserve districts have managed to build campgrounds that feel
like campgrounds rather than golf courses: McHenry County's [Marengo
Ridge](/marengo-ridge/), DuPage County's [Blackwell Forest
Preserve](/blackwell-forest-preserve/), and Winnebago County's [Sugar
River Forest Preserve](/sugar-river/). There is no reason Cook County
shouldn't be able to do the same.

We woke early this morning and, with a quick stop at the
always-delicious Cal-Harbor Restaurant in Pullman, headed to the
95th Red Line station and caught the train home.
