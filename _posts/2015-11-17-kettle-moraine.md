Ever since John at [Uptown Bikes](http://www.uptownbikes.com/)
mentioned that the campgrounds in Wisconsin's Kettle Moraine State
Forest are within striking distance of the Harvard Metra stop--in my
mind I'd always imagined they were much further--I've been wanting to
make the trip.

This weekend (the last before we leave the country for two weeks) was
forecast to be unseasonably warm and sunny and M-- and I had planned a
trip to Illinois Beach State Park, where she's never stayed. But at
the last minute she got sick and decided to stay home. Since I've been
to Illinois Beach before, I thought I'd try for Kettle Moraine
instead. The campgrounds (there are several in the Kettle Moraine
State Forest) where we've stayed while car-camping in the
past--Whitewater Lake and Pinewoods (my favorite)--closed at the end
of October, but the Ottawa Lake campground is open year-round.

The sun sets pretty early these days here, so I left in the morning to
make sure I'd reach the campground in daylight. I headed north out of
Harvard through the unincorporated community of Lawrence and across
the Wisconsin border.

My first stop in Wisconsin was Delavan, known to some for its circus
history (motto: "19th Century Circus Capital of America"), to others
as the hometown of Wisconsin's dreadful governor, but to me primarily
as the starting point for the
[Great Lakes Randonneurs](http://www.greatlakesrando.org/)' brevet
series, which I've always wanted to ride but never have.[^1] Perhaps
because of its randonneuring associations I had high hopes for this
town, but I was disappointed. It seemed an exceptionally smug place
with little to be smug about. At every curb cut there are stenciled
proscriptions against parking your bike on the sidewalk (where, one
wonders, is one to park? the implied answer, I think, is not in
Delavan). After a foolhardy attempt at breakfast at an establishment
serving "American fries" I cut my losses and tried to leave town,
eventually succeeding after trying numerous streets which seemed like
they ought to connect up with County Road O on my map, but instead
dead-ended at cemeteries and megachurches.

County Road O, surrounded by farmland, might have been scenic in
July, but in November the fields were dirt and the views monotonous;
but soon I reached the edges of the eponymous moraine. The land
grew more undulating and the roads twistier. Approaching Palmyra (the
next, and last, town through which I'd pass) there were an
embarassment of quiet back roads (including the one pictured above),
and I only wish I'd had a chance to ride more of them.

Palmyra itself is a lovely town on a lovely little lake in which I
should have stopped but didn't. I'd forgotten, but M-- and I stopped
here for breakfast (and some nice enameled camp mugs at the excellent
hardware store) a couple years ago on a car-camping trip to Whitewater
Lake.

Another eight miles found me at my destination, and I set up camp in
one of the secluded walk-in sites overlooking Ottawa Lake itself. It
turned out that--while it's open year-round--the Ottawa Lake
campground is unstaffed after October, and no firewood is available,
so I had to make do with the few scraps of wood I could gather to
build a short-lived fire, after which I retreated to my tent for the
night.

In the morning, worried about making the 12:35 PM train (the last for
four hours), I headed out early and skipped the most scenic country
roads in favor of more direct routes. Because of this (and because the
previous day's tailwind was now a headwind) the ride became a bit of a
slog; but I found myself back in Harvard with enough time to grab
three astonishingly good tacos al pastor from
[La Loncherita](http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-loncherita-harvard).

## Equipment notes

This was my first ride with the fantastic Ocean Air Cycles
[Docena demi-porteur bag](http://oceanaircycles.com/2014/05/28/docena-demi-porteur-bag/)
(made by [Swift](http://builtbyswift.com/)), which worked very
well. The two-level main compartment with expandable lower section
let me easily separate snacks and camera (on top) from camping gear
and clothing (on the bottom). While I prefer my smaller Treetop
[tall rando bag](http://treetop.bigcartel.com/product/tall-rando-bag-red-waxed-canvas)
for day rides, the extra capacity and (especially) organization of the
Docena are perfect for camping trips. In warmer weather I could easily
camp with just this bag and the Revelate Pika.

The Swift
[Zeitgeist saddle bag](http://builtbyswift.com/shop/zeitgeist-saddle-bag/)'s
drawcord ripped its way out of its nylon sleeve while I was packing
for this trip and is currently on its way back to Swift for
repairs. This was a little disappointing (it was only my second
overnight trip with this bag), but I was able to continue by using
only the side-release buckles to close the bag.

This was also my first trip with the
[Tarptent ProTrail](https://www.tarptent.com/protrail.html). I really
like this tent. With the optional poles (it's designed for use with
trekking poles) it weighs under two pounds; it's very packable (it's
the gray-green bundle strapped to the back of the saddle bag in the above
photo, and it's packed very loosely there). The setup (once you get the hang of it) is much less fiddly
than it seems, and the tent is very secure once pitched. The end
(vs. side) entrance is not ideal, but it bothered me less than I
expected, and I think it's worth it for the simplicity it enables.

[^1]: And probably never will, since it looks like I'll leave Chicago before the next series in the spring.
