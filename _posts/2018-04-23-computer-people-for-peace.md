Recently [The
Outline](https://theoutline.com/post/4029/computer-people-for-peace-history)
published a piece on Computer People for Peace, a 1960s-1970s activist
group originating in New York but with numerous chapters
nationally. Some folks from the [Tech Workers'
Coalition](https://www.techworkerscoalition.org/) were looking for
someone near one of the
[libraries](https://www.worldcat.org/title/interrupt-newsletter-of-computer-people-for-peace/oclc/13143528&referer=brief_results)
which hold copies of the CPP's newsletter _Interrupt_ to scan them,
and as
[the Tamiment at NYU](https://library.nyu.edu/locations/the-tamiment-library-robert-f-wagner-labor-archives/)
is one of those libraries, I spent last Friday afternoon there.

While I haven't had a chance to read through all of them yet, I did
learn that the group originated as "Computer Professionals for Peace";
in October 1970 "Professionals" was replaced with "People" because
members "felt that the 'Professional' label limited the potential
scope of the group and smacked of elitism." It eventually had chapters
(or at least local organizing contacts) in Boston, Chicago, Detroit,
Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Poughkeepsie,[^1] San Francisco,
Washington, DC, northern New Jersey, and Southern Florida. And its
editors seemed to enjoy printing letters from subscribers complaining
that it was too radical.

(N.B.: Tamiment doesn't have the whole run, only numbers 5-10 and
12-20, and I ran out of time before I could scan number 20 (which was
unique in being published by the Chicago rather than the New York
branch). I apologize for the poor-to-very-poor quality of these
images; Tamiment doesn't provide a copier or scanner which patrons can
use, so I took pictures with my phone. Some came out better than
others. Hopefully they're mostly legible.)

[^1]: In fact the Poughkeepsie contact gave an address in Beacon, NY, just across the river from my former home in Newburgh. While I would like to attribute this to some secret quality of the mid-Hudson-Valley as a nexus of hidden leftist currents (did you know that ["Banks of Marble"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-o3CJytIPE) was written by an apple farmer living just outside of Newburgh?), this was the heyday of IBM, which had opened a plant in Poughkeepsie in 1948 and employed many computer workers throughout the region.
