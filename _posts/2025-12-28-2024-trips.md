{% rokka_photo 966d59 "Trout Pond campsite" %}

I figure I have to post these roundups for one year sometime during
the next year--after that, it's too late. This time, with three days
let in 2025, it looks like I'm going to make it by the skin of my
teeth.

I spent 21 nights outside in 2024.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> December 31-January 1: NYE at Roosa Gap

Yes, I'm counting this twice (for 2023 and 2024).

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> January 13-14: RPH Shelter

Famously, you can order pizza delivered to the RPH[^1] Shelter--some
people seem to consider that a selling point. Mimi spoke highly of
this one so Alex E decided to try it out. Sorry, Mimi--this shelter
sucks. It's an ugly concrete thing close enough to somebody's house
that you can see into their windows and close enough to the road to
hear every car. There are at least a dozen very-aggressive signs
forbidding fires. The clearing around the shelter was totally flooded,
which meant wet feet for me. The temperature dropped overnight and in
the morning I lost the feeling in my toes on the ride to the
diner. 0/10 AT shelter--fuck this place.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> January 27-28: Hemlocks Shelter (disaster!)

{% rokka_photo 61c0d3 "Cold at the lean-to" %}

This trip was planned far in advance to coincide with a rare gap in
Alex S's childcare obligations. As the date grew near it became clear
that the weather would be awful--but we were committed. I made the
mistake of planning the route and choosing the campsite. On this
sodden weekend, the quiet dirt roads I chose were mud-pits; the brief
(15-minute) hike-a-bike in to camp was half underwater (on the way in)
and half iced-over (on the way out). This did not endear me to the
larger party.

However, our ultimate arrival at the Hemlocks Shelter was
smiled-upon. Someone had left dry firewood under the shelter, and we
had a proper fire. This shelter is palatial, with bunk beds and a
sleeping loft and a picnic table sheltered from the rain. The night
went well enough, though everyone's shoes were soaked through and
Scott wondered aloud if we should conserve food in case we were
trapped by the icy terrain for multiple days.

In the morning we descended in freezing rain. By the time we rolled up
to the diner in Millerton for restorative bowls of pho, our
derailleurs were iced up and nobody could shift. "_Obviously_, I
should have just planned a day ride!" Alex exclaimed upon entering the
diner. I nodded agreement, but it was a lie; my secret is, I love
these trips where everything goes wrong. It's not an adventure if you
know what's going to happen, is it?

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> March 16-17: California Hill

A classic route to a classic overnight destination with Josh and
Jason. The weather was fine and the riding was nice, but I had just
entered a distressing period that ended a month or two later with my
divorce, and I spent this trip deep in my head.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> April 7-9: Eclipse

{% rokka_photo fb28ec "Watching the eclipse" %}

I had never seen a solar eclipse from the path of totality, and I
don't think I would have made the effort this time if Josh had not
planned the whole thing. Turns out an eclipse is a transcendent
experience. We ended up watching from South Hero Island in the middle
of Lake Champlain, on a grassy knoll with a bunch of WPI-alum
engineers who had met up for the occasion. It was incredible to watch
the animals and birds lose it during totality, _while also feeling
yourself react in just the same way_--to realize that after all, I'm
just another animal getting my mind blown by something totally outside
its experience.

Other trip highlights included:
- running into NYC bike friend Ellen
randomly on the bike path in Burlington (it seemed like half of New
York was in Vermont for the eclipse)
- meeting a retired executive director of the [Adventure Cycling
  Association](https://www.adventurecycling.org) on the
  Essex-Charlotte ferry
- and my first [Warmshowers](https://www.warmshowers.org) stays

We hung our hammocks
in a cyclist's yard in Burlington, just off the lake; in the morning
she made us buckwheat pancakes. The second night was spent in a state
forest where we were harassed for hours by an angry beaver slapping
its tail against the water; and then the last night we stayed stayed
behind a farmhouse, with sunset views and a roaring fire.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> May 18-19: Herschel's Rideout

Herschel quit his job and rode across the country like we all dream
of, and a dozen or so of us went with him for the first night. We
camped somewhere in New Jersey and stumbled into an old-timey dance in
an antique barn. Sarah--some months pregnant--rode out and camped and
then the next day rode to take the train to ride to somebody's
wedding.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> May 25-27: Cazenovia for Memorial Day

{% rokka_photo 8e3441 %}

Mimi planned this trip around a friend-of-a-friend's annual Memorial
Day cookout in their historic house, [Tall
Pines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_Pines_(Cazenovia,_New_York))
in Cazenovia, New York. I was newly single, a little lonely, and glad
to spend a few days with friends.  The weather turned as we (Mimi,
Annie, Shanit, and I) were arriving in Cazenovia, and we were glad to
have a place to spend the night indoors. We dined well on a whole
roast (on a spit) lamb.

One the second day the weather had cleared. We spent a while at the
beautiful Chittenango Falls, rode for a bit on the Erie Canal towpath,
and ended up camping near a graveyard in the woods in Morgan Hill
State Forest. From there it was a quick ride back to the cars in
Truxton, where we rode into town on Main Street alongside the Memorial
Day parade.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> June 7-9: Harriman for Mimi's and Michelle's birthdays

We rode up to one of the Cedar Pond group sites on Friday afternoon
for a leisurely evening of swimming.

In the morning I rode down the mountain for a decadent breakfast at
[Dottie Audrey's](https://www.dottieaudreys.com)--then back up. On the
second evening we had a proper birthday celebration for Mimi and
Michelle, and I managed to set my camping stove on fire.

On Sunday we descended to the Haverstraw ferry, which now finally runs
on weekends during the summer. It makes for a nice connection across
the river to the train in Ossining after a Harriman trip. In this case
we had the ferry entirely to ourselves.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> June 17-21: [Vermont](/five-percent-of-vermont)!

This trip got its own post. Unmentioned there was the promising first
date I had the night before I left for the trip. It went unmentioned
because when I wrote that post, there hadn't yet been a second
date. But a few days later we had that second date, and many more
after that.

## <span class="emoji">🥾</span> August 1-2: Trout Pond with Maria

{% rokka_photo 0712a4 %}

One of those dates was a camping trip to Trout Pond, off of Russell
Brook Road in the Catskills. I'd been there a few times before, but we
found a new site I'd never seen and slept under the stars.

In the morning we packed up (disturbing a snake living in our fire
ring). The whole lake seemed empty and it was hot, so we
risked a quick nude swim on our way out. But while we were in the
water, two men arrived and began setting up right next to where we had
piled our clothes on a log.

We froze. There was no way to get to our clothes without exposing
ourselves. While we were trying to figure out what to do, the older of
the two men called out, "Are you _naked?_" When we replied (abashedly)
in the affirmative, he continued: "Oh, then you won't mind if _I'm_
naked!" And he proceeded to undress and to enter the lake. He
introduced himself as Claudio, and proceeded to tell us all about the
best nude swimming holes in the Catskills and the Hudson Valley, and
how they were being ruined by prudish city people.

I managed to let all of the gas out of the fuel canister so we went
without a hot camp breakfast and stopped instead at a diner in
Livingston Manor, and then at the [Catskill Art
Space](https://www.catskillartspace.org) to catch [James Turrell's
_Avaar_](https://www.catskillartspace.org/james-turrell-avaar) and
[Francis Cape's _Utopian
Benches_](https://www.catskillartspace.org/francis-cape-utopian-benches)
exhibits.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> August 31-September 2: Roundabout Brattleboro with Alex, Freely, Ben, and Alan

I have too much to say about this trip to say it here, and half a
draft of a separate post that I hope to complete someday.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> October 12-13: Wolf Brook with Josh and Jason

In New York State, the Department of Environmental Conservation owns a
bunch of parcels of land designated as Multiple Use Areas. These are
generally undeveloped with no facilities other than maybe a gravel
parking area with a sign. As the name suggests, they are open to many
uses: hiking, hunting, fishing, and, usually, camping.

One of my favorite activities is "find a random Multiple Use Area on
the map that I've never been to, ride there, and try to camp." Some of
these areas have established campsites with fire rings, natural water
sources, nice views, etc. Other times, you end up bushwacking through
rocky terrain on the side of a hill looking for the least-bad spot to
sleep. This trip to Wolf Brook MUA was more the latter than the
former, and it didn't help that we arrived in the dark. But we had a
glorious long ride (85 miles!) through the Catskills to get there,
with the foliage at near-peak.

## <span class="emoji">🚗</span> October 19-20: Hannah's Birthday with Maria

I credit that first date with Maria to the following paragraph in my
online-dating profile:

> I love to camp—mostly bike-camping with a little backpacking and
> car-camping thrown in. My idea of a peak experience: riding bikes
> with friends to a campsite by a lake and swimming by firelight
> someplace where it’s dark enough to see the Milky Way.

Maria's interest in camping arose through her goddaughter,
Hannah. Hannah is a big fan of the Outdoor Boys on Youtube, and so in
2023 for her sixth birthday she asked for a camping trip. This was
Maria's first time camping (like me, she grew up thinking of herself
as a thoroughly indoor person), and she found she enjoyed it enough to
think it might be fun to date a camping person.

So it was very nice to be invited to join Maria for Hannah's seventh
birthday at Hickory Run State Park in Pennsylvania. We made s'mores,
ate over-the-top Korean campsite food prepared by Hannah's
grandmother, and hiked the Shades of Death trail.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> November 16-17: Stewart Hollow Brook

{% rokka_photo 233cb7 %}

A chilly trip to one of my favorite campsites, and the last of the
year for me, because on December 14 we flew to Mexico to spend a month
catsitting. This was a choose-your-own-adventure trip where a bunch of
us took different routes of varying length and difficulty, meeting up
in Kent, CT for a bougie restaurant dinner before riding the last five
miles to camp in the dark by dynamo light. In the morning we rode some
new roads up over the ridge to Dover Plains.
