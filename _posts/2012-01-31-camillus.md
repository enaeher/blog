title: An Indianapolis acquisition.
---

I spent last weekend in Indianapolis avoiding the Super Bowl. On Sunday morning I headed back to Chicago, having gorged myself on blueberry waffles with peach butter at <a href="http://www.maxineschicken.com/main.htm">Maxine's Chicken &amp; Waffles</a>, and carrying a new knife:

It cost $5 at <a href="http://www.indianareclamation.com">Reclaimed</a> so I really had no choice but to buy it. I didn't know what "Camillus" meant:

[Apparently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camillus_Cutlery_Company) the Camillus Cutlery Company (of <a href="http://townofcamillus.com/">Camillus, NY</a>) was one of the oldest knife manufacturers in the US. In 2006 the workers (represented by the United Steelworkers) went on <a href="http://capitalregion.ynn.com/content/top_stories/18682/camillus-cutlery-workers-on-strike/">strike</a> after the company cut working hours and pay. The strike turned into a lockout; eventually the plant <a href="http://capitalregion.ynn.com/content/top_stories/26919/camillus-cutlery-to-close-its-doors/">was shut down</a> in early 2007, a few months after the workers approved a contract and went back to work. The factory is being turned into <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/skaneateles_developer_buys_cam.html">a medical center and condos</a>. The Camillus name lives on as a <a href="http://camillusknives.com/">zombie brand</a> used to sell imported knives.

You can get a sense of the history of Camillus in this [official company history](http://web.archive.org/web/20060509191429/http://www.camillusknives.com/1mainframe.htm?history.shtml~main) from the Wayback Machine.

It seems a lot of people collect these. There are <a href="http://www.collectors-of-camillus.us/">websites</a> and <a href="http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/forumdisplay.php/695-Camillus-Collector-s-Forum">forums</a> devoted to the company, full of much more exciting examples than my simple scout knife. But I like it&mdash;it reminds me of my mother's pocket knife that she's had since she was a child growing up on a farm in upstate New York.
