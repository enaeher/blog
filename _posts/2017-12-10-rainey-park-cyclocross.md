M-- left for her run this morning, and texted me a few minutes later:
"They're doing cyclocross at the park by Costco." This is how I
learned that [the only cross racing in New York
City](https://www.bikereg.com/36694) happens blocks from my
apartment. Of course I had to head over and have a look.

This was only the second cross race I've attended (the first being the
racing at [Montrose
Beach](https://www.flickr.com/photos/56883654@N04/albums/72157690185424174/with/11259884515/)
in Chicago several years ago) but it's my favorite type of bike racing
to watch, and today's conditions--the day after the first snowfall of
the year--made it even more interesting.

I missed the singlespeed race but caught the women's and men's Cat
1/2/3. All in all this was a great surprise on a lazy Sunday.
