title: Sleeping outside in 2023.

I spent a bit over 30 nights outside in 2023.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> January 21-22: Ferncliff Forest

{% rokka_photo cae52030e00992bbd28328cf506dc465a53ccc35 "Riding to camp" %}

A few of us rode to Ferncliff Forest from Pawling; M-- drove and met
us there. I was chased by an elderly gun enthusiast through the old
Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center campus, more recently used by the
cult front organization Olivet University until it was [shut down by
the
state](https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2022/07/07/olivet-university-in-dover-ordered-closed-whats-next-for-campus/65367711007/)
for its many criminal activities. Without further incident we made it
to Rhinebeck for excellent Indian food, and then a few miles further
to the forest.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> February 18-19: Housatonic River Valley with Colin

The camping cyclist in the greater New York area learns to expect a
stiff climb at the end of the day--valley campsites are few and far
between. But there are a handful of them. The Stewart Hollow Brook AT
shelter is right on the banks of the Housatonic River, and just a
short ride from services in Kent, Connecticut. We had great weather,
nice roads, and the company of a few local backpackers and their dogs
at the shelter. For Colin, this would be his last time camping before
the birth of his son.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> April 8-9: Wild Pennsylvania trip with ADV

{% rokka_photo 1de2ab "John in an old rail tunnel" %}

Phil has a big bike van so he gets out to Pennsylvania more than most
New York riders (you can't really get there on the train), and he and
Mimi put this route together based on some favorite roads and some
hoped-for connections. One of the latter turned into a real
ankle-breaker of a rocky hike-a-bike that spat us out in the backyard
of some friendly locals, but it was a great route overall. We were in
Amish country much of the time--we saw bike racks on the backs of
buggies, and buggy parking at the bike shops.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> May 6-7: Over the Shawangunk Ridge, twice

{% rokka_photo 7348a8 "At Awosting Falls" %}

Josh's friend Brian was running the [Rock the
Ridge](https://www.mohonkpreserve.org/rock-the-ridge/) trail run, so
we planned an overnighter that took us up on the Shawangunk ridge
where we were able to meet him at one of the aid stations. We
continued on through Minnewaska to Ellenville for the essential [Aroma
Thyme](https://www.aromathymebistro.com) stop, then partway up the
ridge again to camp along Old Route 52 (now a rocky, rutted woods
road). We had high hopes for finding a nice campsite here, but the
terrain was steep and it was hard to find anywhere flattish except
right by the trail. Still, we had a nice night and met Brian again in
New Paltz for breakfast the next morning.

## <span class="emoji">🚗</span> May 20-21: Crystal Lake Wild Forest

{% rokka_photo 136972 "Watching the rain on Crystal Lake" %}

Like everyone else in the city, M-- and I often indulge in the
(entirely impracticable) fantasy of buying a weekend place in the
country, and sometimes this fantasy proceeds to the point that we
actually go to look at something for sale. This was one such occasion;
a nineteenth-century one-room schoolhouse was listed at a pre-pandemic
price, and we couldn't resist. Neither could anybody else; when we
arrived at the open house to find cars parked in a line along the
narrow mountain road, we knew the place would go quickly, above asking
and for all-cash.

Afterward we stopped at the Long Eddy Hotel & Saloon, where the
bartender told me that I wasn't dressed properly for camping. (She was
right.) Then we went on to Crystal Lake Wild Forest.

I had camped there once before, in 2019 during my [Catskills solo
tour](/catskills-delaware-tour/). This time we went a little further
in and found a nicer site, sheltered by tall pines. It started to rain
lightly, so we hung the tarp and sat watching the rain fall on the
lake.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> May 27-29: Memorial Day in Vermont

{% rokka_photo 7dfc3b "Runaway cows" %}

We ended this trip in a pond drinking beers. Along the way we
intercepted an escaped herd of cows running free along the shores of
Lake Champlain and we stopped at farm stands and creamee places. I
have never had a bad time in Vermont.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> June 3-4: Alder Lake

These days when anyone visits us from away, we like (if we can talk
them into it) to take them up to the Hudson Valley or the
Catksills. M--'s niece S-- visits us frequently, and this time we took
her camping at the primitive sites at Alder Lake. The weather was
beautiful (though still cool enough that I was the only one to go
swimming), and while the lake was very busy, we eventually found a
large and lovely lakefront site.

We drove up with my bike on top of the car. In the morning, after
breakfast in Livingston Manor, I rode to Poughkeepsie.

## <span class="emoji">🚗</span> June 10-11: Mimi's Birthday

{% rokka_photo 98e4da "Sunset ride" %}

We drove up to [Dirt Road Camp](https://www.dirtroadcamp.com) for
Mimi's birthday, and spent the day riding bikes through the rolling
farm country of Delaware County (with a notable stop at [Dairy
Fest](https://www.meredithdairyfest.com)). That night around the fire,
I stepped off a short ledge in the dark and landed hard enough to
fracture the fifth metatarsal of my right foot. It turns out that
getting into and out of a hammock with a broken foot is no fun. I
would spend a couple weeks in a boot, only getting back on the bike at
the end of June.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> August 14-25: [Eastern Divide "Lupine"](https://bikepacking.com/routes/edt3/)

{% rokka_photo 6c68b4 "Leaving camp one morning" %}

This was my big trip for 2023 and my longest, hardest ride to date. I
rode from Houlton, Maine, at the New Brunswick border, to Poultney,
Vermont, at the New York border. I had planned the trip for July, but
pushed it back a month to let my foot heal.

This ride was too much to capture here. I was profoundly underbiked
much of the time. It rained hard for five or six of the eleven days of
my trip, and nothing was ever dry. On the hardest day I dragged my
bike along endless miles of mountain bike trails that alternated
between steep and flooded--wanting to bail to the road but unable to
because it was raining too hard to operate the touchscreens of my
phone or Garmin--in hopes of finding a hotel room to dry out, only to
find upon reaching town that each of its several hotels was fully
booked. I rode briefly with a couple riding the entire Eastern Divide
Route (Maine to Florida). I missed a turn one day and did twenty extra
miles. I stayed in Montpelier in the eerie aftermath of the flooding,
every single shop closed for block after block. I ended my ride in
Poultney, Vermont, where Michael let me stay at his place for a night
and where I met a sea captain in the pub. In the morning I caught the
train home from nearby Castleton; before I embarked, two touring
cyclists on Rivendells disembarked. For them, the train was very
convenient; they lived in an apartment in the Amtrak station.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> September 3-4: Stewart Hollow Brook again

There were supposed to be several of us on this trip, but everyone
bailed except Leo and me. We arrived just in time to sit in the river
drinking beer, moving to stay in the sun as it set because the water
was too cold in the shade.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> September 16-17: Annie's birthday ride

{% rokka_photo 546f88 "Campsite cupcake" %}

It was Annie's birthday and, like me, she believes that every trip
should involve swimming. We were pushing the limits of the
lake-swimming season at this point, but it was still just warm enough
to enjoy it--the trick is to get in the water right away, while you're
still hot and sweaty from the ride, before you cool off and come to
your senses. None of us had been to this site before; the trail to
camp was unexpectedly rugged, but the pond was lovely (though
troublingly full of dead snails) and we had a clear view of the
sunset.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> October 1-6: Minnesota section of the [Northwoods Route](https://bikepackingroots.org/project/the-northwoods-route/)

{% rokka_photo 82e962 "Split Rock Lighthouse (view from our campsite)" %}

In a time of layoffs, is it worse to take a bunch of time off and
maybe put yourself at the top of the list, or to keep your nose to the
grindstone and then feel like a chump when you're laid off anyway? I
don't know, but when John told me that this was the only week he could
do a trip this year, I didn't hesitate despite my two-week solo trip
barely a month earlier. Mimi ended up joining at the last minute.

It was a great trip and a great route. This is what I'd wanted the
Eastern Divide to be: beautiful scenery, flowy gravel roads,
spectacular campsites. (Turns out they aren't kidding about the 10,000
lakes. We grew so spoiled that if we didn't like the look of one
lakefront campsite, we just kept rolling; there was always another
lake a couple miles down the road.)

We had perfect weather until the last night, when it grew cold and
rainy, and which we were expecting to spend camping in a clearing in a
forest with no amenities; instead we found a beautiful lean-to (with
not one but two vault toilets!) stocked with a massive quantity of dry
firewood.

## <span class="emoji">🥾</span> October 21-22: Harriman with Daniel, Sean, and Esmi

Only now as I write this am I realizing that this was my only
backpacking trip in 2023. That's a shame; I like bikes, but I think
I'd like to do a little more hiking in 2024. This was a quick one,
just up to the West Mountain shelter from the Tomkins Cove trailhead,
but we had great weather and views, and it was good to see this crew
for the first time since Sean and Esmi's wedding. It was also a
bittersweet trip, since Daniel was about to leave New York a few weeks
later.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> October 28-29: Spooky Ride with Mimi and Herschel

{% rokka_photo 319bc1 "Cyborg oracle at the Haunted Mill" %}

Mimi planned this trip and she set down one rule: _costumes
mandatory_. In the end there were only three of us, and I would
characterize my costume (a pumpkin) as
abstract-leaning-toward-perfunctory, but it was good enough for a
passing driver to tell her child "Look! a pumpkin and a pizza!" as she
passed. (Herschel was the pizza.) We visited a u-pick apple orchard
with corn maze (nightmarish, a mob scene), the famous [Dover Stone
Church](https://hikethehudsonvalley.com/hikes/dover-stone-church/)
(which is not a church but a cave) and the [Wassaic
Project](https://www.wassaicproject.org)'s Haunted Mill
(amazing). Then we bushwacked around some nearby DEC land for an hour
trying to find a decent campsite (with eventual success). In the
morning we woke up to the sound of shotguns; camping on DEC land in
the fall is always a little risky, and hunters get started pretty
early. We packed up quick and headed the few miles to Dover Plains for
breakfast and the train.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> November 11-12: Taconic State Park

I've probably wild-camped a half-dozen times up on the Taconic Ridge
near here, but I'd never stayed at the official campground at the foot
of the ridge on the New York side until this trip. It was colder than
expected, and our group got a bit spread out over the course of the
day, but it was a beautiful ride and for the first time I descended
Sunset Rock Road at sunset. I can be a bit of a snob about pay
campgrounds, but this was a nice one, a hammocker's paradise of
perfectly-spaced tall pines.

We rode into Copake for dinner, and were met by one rider's local
friends. It turned out that one of those friends is restoring the old
[Copake depot](https://www.instagram.com/copakedepot)--which process
I'd been following on Instagram for years (I once dragged M-- out to
the depot to peer in the windows and scope it out when we were
nearby).

## <span class="emoji">🚗</span> November 22-24: Thanksgiving in New England

{% rokka_photo 37f996 "Lake Willoughby, Vermont" %}

M-- was in Albany for work immediately before Thanksgiving, so I
tagged along, and we drove up into Vermont and then New Hampshire over
the holiday. I'm not a fan of long days spent in the car, but if
you've got to drive, Vermont is a pretty nice place for it. I bought a
blaze-orange wool jacket at [Johnson Woolen
Mills](https://www.johnsonwoolenmills.com) and Christmas-y beers at
Hill Farmstead; we got stuck in a ditch trying to drive up an uplowed
trailhead access road; camped at a random spot in the woods after we
got towed out, then at the beautiful US Forest Service Fourth Iron
campground in New Hampshire the following night; took the cog railway
halfway up Mt Washington (sadly it does not go to the top in the
winter); stayed a night in Montpelier which was finally starting to
reopen after the summer flooding; and fought our way back home through
endless hours of post-holiday traffic. This would end up being the
last trip in our trusty 2005 Outback, and it was a pretty good note to
go out on.

## <span class="emoji">🚲</span> December 31-January 1: NYE at Roosa Gap

{% rokka_photo 4b6930 "Under the fire tower" %}

New Year's Eve is best spent outdoors, I firmly believe. M-- and I
have spent the holiday camping on a number of occasions, but this year
there was a like-minded group from NYC-ADV and a few different groups
were going to meet up at the Roosa Gap fire tower.

It was a cold day and windy going through Minnewaska. After descending
from the Sam's Point trailhead, we had to climb back up to Roosa Gap,
and we were both pretty toasted when we finally reached the parking
lot.

There was a larger ADV group for whom this would be the second night
of a two-nighter, and we had been entertaining the idea that we'd
arrive in camp and this other group would already have a roaring fire
going. But it turned out that they had instead encountered some
misadventure, and when we arrived only M-- was there in her
Zipcar. She ended up shuttling many of the ADV group up to camp, but
we had our fire in the end, and champagne toasts, and some nice New
Year's views.
