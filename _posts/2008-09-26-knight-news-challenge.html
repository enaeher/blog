title: The Knight News Challenge meetup.
---

<p>
I'm just back from the <a href="http://garage.newschallenge.org/news-challenge-meetup-tonight-630-chicagos-columbia-college">Knight News Challenge meetup</a> downtown &mdash; this is the <a href="http://newschallenge.org">grant program</a> that funds <a href="http://chitowndailynews.org">the <i>Chi-Town Daily News</i></a>, the <a href="http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/admissions/page.aspx?id=58645">Knight Foundation Scholarships</a> for programmers at Medill, and <a href="http://www.everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</a>. (If I'm missing anyone here in Chicago, please let me know.)
</p>
<p>
Frank Edwards from the <i>Chi-Town Daily News</i> and <a href="http://sixthw.com/">Brian Boyer</a>, a recipient of one of the Medill scholarships, spoke, along with staff from the Knight Foundation. There were nearly 30 prospective applicants present, a turnout that surprised me, though perhaps it shouldn't have.
</p>
<p>
Some interesting numbers from the Foundation: the fifteen winners came last year from a pool of around 3,000, whittled down to 64 for the final judges by a panel of screening judges.

<p>
(It's worth noting that I also got my first glimpse of the <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/products/productpage.cfm?prodid=1916">Zoom H2</a> audio recorder at this meeting, a device <i>au courant</i> among the more hifalutin' of your podcasting types and one I've been wanting for some time.)
</p>
<p>
It was a fun event which drew an interesting group of people &mdash; I regret not having been able to meet more of them.
