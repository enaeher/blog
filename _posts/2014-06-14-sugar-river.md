Yesterday we took a too-quick overnight trip to the <a href="http://wcfpd.org/preserves/sugar-river/">Sugar River Forest Preserve</a> in Winnebago County. There are walk-in sites right on the banks of the Sugar River, and we were lucky enough to snag the last one even though we arrived late after a dinner in nearby Rockton.

Although the walk-in sites don't have much privacy from one another, they are nicely isolated from the road and it's lovely to be right on the river. We woke to see some of our neighbors fishing (the exceptionally-friendly camground hosts told us that the river is full of catfish). We had grand plans for a hearty breakfast to be prepared on the Trangia alcohol cookstove which M&dash; gave me for Christmas, but a raccoon absconded with our hash browns, corn, and onion in the middle of the night. Luckily we still had some tomatoes, mushrooms, and eggs to start our day off.

We had to rush back to the city, but we are already planning our next trip to Sugar River.
