I took a nicely chilly ride today up to the Mid-Hudson Bridge, across,
and back down the east side of the Hudson. Pretty sure I saw a nice
blue [Zanconato](http://cycling.zanconato.com/) on River Road just
south of Marlboro.

I broke the Sigma 30mm f2.8 lens that has been my go-to for my Sony
NEX-5N, and I wasn't feeling the phone camera today, so I dug out one
of my old eBayed manual-focus lenses,
the
[Industar 55mm f2.8](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/industar/55mm-f28.htm) from
the Ukraine. This is not a very good lens, and I am not very good at
using it, but I like the effect. It lends a bit of an apocalyptic
feeling that seems to suit the present moment.

If you get a chance to ride the Old Indian Trail Road to the landing
in Milton, take it, and then curse my name as you fight your back up
Dock Road.

On paper, you can cut through Franny Reese State Park to get to the
western end of the Mid-Hudson Bridge from the south. In practice, I
was my 28mm tires pretty far on these trails. However, it's worth it
for the wildlife (I tried and failed to get a picture of the hawk I
saw carrying a squirrel) and the views down toward the bridge.

I didn't manage many pictures on the return leg, but I did catch this
barge from the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge as I crossed back over to
Newburgh.
