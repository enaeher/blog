title: Where is CloutWiki?
---

<p>
A few weeks ago CloutWiki started serving up 404 error pages. Now they've got a 301 permanent redirect to clouttracker.org, which is serving up a page with a <code>meta</code> element <code>http-equiv</code> redirect back to cloutwiki.org, and round and round. I haven't gotten any response to my email. Does anyone know what's going on?

(My apologies for the thin updates <strike>lately</strike> so far. There are things in the queue.)
