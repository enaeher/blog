title: Roundabout Brattleboro with a six-year-old.
---

I mark time by bike trips. Two trips bookended the summer of 2024:

Over Memorial Day weekend, I joined
[Mimi](https://winepacking.substack.com) and Annie and Shanit on a
trip through Central New York. We stopped at wineries and farm stands
and roadside ice cream spots, and stayed one night in [a house with a
Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_Pines_(Cazenovia,_New_York)),
owned by friends of friends who were roasting a whole goat for the
occasion. It was a strange time for me; I was getting divorced and my
ex-wife had moved out only a couple weeks before. A ride with friends
was the perfect distraction, but it was hard to focus. I felt _very_
single.[^1]

For Labor Day weekend, Josh and Jason were planning a road ride to
[Glen Falls House](https://glenfallshouse.com) in the Catskills, where
they hold raves and there's a hot tub and you can camp in the woods
out back. I was planning to join them, but it turns out I'm a bad
friend: when, at the last minute, a spot opened up to go to Vermont to
ride Joe Cruz's [Roundabout
Brattleboro](https://bikepacking.com/routes/roundabout-brattleboro/)
route, I bailed on the hot tub and threw my bike in the back of the
rented pickup truck early Saturday morning.

The thing about this trip that made it impossible to resist was: Alex
Estes was going to do it on a cargo bike with his six-year-old son on
the back.

Itt's hard to convey how straightforwardly lunatic an idea this
is. Roundabout Brattleboro (like all of Joe Cruz's routes in Vermont)
is challenging for a strong rider on a gravel bike. You're climbing
nonstop the whole time, often on rutted, rocky, and overgrown
snowmobile trails. Adding a heavy cargo bike and a child is a
choice outside the bikepacking normal range.

### Beginning

There are cargo bikes and cargo bikes. Alex's was the Bike Friday
Haul-a-Day, which he'd found on Craigslist for something like $500. It
was pretty beat-up but it let him ride with his son Freely all over
New York. They took the bike to and from school each day, from their
apartment on West 21st to mine way uptown at 148th, over the bridges
to Brooklyn, and occasionally on suburban overnight camping
trips. Alex wanted Freely to experience the city the way he did, and
this bike made that possible.

Alex also wanted Freely to experience the kind of riding he did on his
own: long, grueling bikepacking trips, the tougher the better. Plenty
of people enjoy pushing themselves, but not like Alex. He threw
himself into randonneuring; he made a serious attempt at Everesting
(foiled at the 11th hour by the cops); he attacked Conan Thai's Soft
Rock Hard Times bikepacking route (then yet-to-be-completed) several
times. Long gravel rides like the Roundabout Brattleboro were on the
tamer end of the spectrum for him.

At six, Freely would soon be too big to ride on the back of the
Haul-a-Day, so Alex felt like a window was closing. And that's how we
found ourselves unloading our bikes at Molly Stark State Park in
Vermont coming into Labor Day weekend.

### First day

Because I'm a bad person, I joined this trip in large part because I
expected disaster and thought it would make a good story. But there
was no disaster. Alex finished the route as he'd planned.

Things got off to an inauspicious start: a shifting issue surfaced in
the first few miles, and he ended up being able to use only the
biggest and smallest cogs on his cassette. The chain wouldn't stay on
the middle cogs. Fortunately there is not much flat ground in Vermont,
so this didn't slow him down too much.

The first day went smoothly, with few stops. We camped at one of the
dispersed campsites along Castle Brook Road in the Green Mountain
National Forest, just as I'd done on my previous ride of this
route. Freely chose the site, which was a bit muddy and, I have to
say, not entirely optimal--but then he is only six. It was a rainy
night, and we hung out under a tarp drinking maple-ginger tea and
toppling over when our Helinox chairs sank too deeply into the mud.

Alan blew my mind by staking out his bike with a pair of tent stakes
(pictured). For my entire bike-camping career, I'd been leaning my
bike against a tree like an asshole. Sometimes you want something out
of a bag and it's stuck between bike and tree; moron! Stupid! A better
path was illuminated.

In the morning Alan found that his Nalgene was rubbing his big ring;
Ben decided to document the resulting trailside engineering (a stick
Voile'd between cage and bottle).

### Up and up

Castle Brook Road gets rockier and more uphill as you go north. This
year, too, large sections were underwater, flooded by beaver dams. At
the top there was a brief respite on pavement before we turned onto
the IP road over Stratton. As usual, the descent was a grind of rutted
grass and blackflies.

I was behind Alan, and at the bottom, where there's a bridge over the
Winhall River, I saw his bike--but not Alan. Instead there were two
other bikepackers. I asked if they'd seen my friend and they pointed
into the river, where Alan was cooling off.

These bikepackers also turned out to be from New York, and one rode a
Bridgestone MB-1 from the 90s. I mentioned that our friend Conan had a
[similar
rig](https://bikepacking.com/bikes/conans-1989-bridgestone-mb-1/) and
of course they'd read all about it online (and seemed a little
impressed that we knew Conan).

Ben caught up shortly but Alex was still behind when we continued
on. I love swimming at the Stratton snow-making pond just after the IP
road descent, and I talked it up well enough to convince Alan and Ben
to take the short detour to take a dip. Alex hated swimming[^2] so he
leapfrogged us while we were in the pond and went ahead to the gas
station in Winhall to stock up on junk food for Freely (whose very
particular tastes in Flamin Hot Cheetos Alex was trying to indulge as
much as possible on this trip, where so much else was unfamiliar and
uncomfortable). Alan and Ben and I went ahead to
[Honeypie](https://www.eatathoneypie.com) in Rawsonville (a highlight
whenver I've passed through here) for burgers and milkshakes.

The line was pretty long and as I waited, Alex called me from the gas
station in Winhall. He was asking me for $100 to help him buy snacks
for Freely because his bank account had gone negative. I Venmo'd the
money and he called back a few minutes later ... he'd been able to get
some snacks but the rest of the $100 had been eaten up by overdraft
fees and he was asking for another $100 for the rest of the trip. I
ended up giving him cash for the second $100 to avoid any chance of
bank fees taking the money.

I've thought a lot about this moment in the months since. Alex had
been out of work for more than a year at this point and I'd watched as
he became increasingly desperate for a job. But he valued autonomy
above most things and I can only imagine how much it pained him to ask
for money. After he died I learned that friends had been paying his
rent for months. I think he hated all of this. But there was one thing
he put above his autonomy: his son.

The burgers and milkshakes at Honeypie were delicious and it was
unappealing to get back on the bike, but we had twenty-five miles to
go.

Everyone was done with chunky hike-a-bike after the IP road--but it
wasn't quite done with us, as bits of the trails along the Winhall
River were eroded and crossed by blow-downs. But after South
Londonderry we were on pavement and smooth gravel all the way to our
dinner stop at the Grafton General Store.

The Grafton store has a little cafe attached--just a single small
dining room. But on this day it was not open to us because it was
serving a private dinner. We sat outside eating snacks and to-go
sandwiches and watched the dinner attendees pull up in a classic
Rolls-Royce, dressed to the nines in high New England WASP style.

[1] I'm writing this now just after Memorial Day 2025, where I again
went camping with the same crew as well as my new partner, whom I met
only a few weeks after this trip last year. This is not an outcome I
would have ever contemplated at the time.

[2] He "didn't like the way water felt on his skin." In 2024 we did
the [Warriors Ride](https://warriorsfunride.nyc) on a sweltering,
humid night from the Bronx to Coney Island. Most everyone went
straight into the ocean at the end. Alex instead sat on the boardwalk
summing up our points (the Warriors Ride is a scavenger hunt where
points are awarded for various activities). He told us he'd only
contemplate swimming if the points it would earn our team would push
us ahead; when it turned out we were far behind the other teams, he
not only declined to go swimming, but told me later that he didn't
even bother to shower after the ride for several days. His bathtub was
primarily used for storing bicycles.
